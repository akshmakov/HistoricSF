==========

A hobby GIS Project To stitch together a large scale map of the San Francisco Bay Area from Historical Topographic Maps

Currently Published as an overlay tile set. The eventual goal is to produce a high quality base map for Historical and Historiagraphic Experimentation.

  The pipeline automates the transformation and cropping of a large set of raster maps
  
- The initial dataset has been created and uploaded to github as a release
- An overlay map is published @
- Color Correction and Graphical Tweaking has not been done.
